# Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an AI-based system for the early detection of skin cancer through dermatoscopic images. Using advanced deep learning techniques, the system classifies skin lesions into benign and malignant categories, helping improve diagnostic accuracy and consistency. The primary goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the increasing demand for accurate skin cancer diagnosis and the limited availability of dermatologists, particularly in underserved areas.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Models**: The project implements several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3, known for their robust image classification capabilities.
- **Model Training**: The models were trained using the **Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset** from Kaggle, which consists of 10,000+ high-resolution dermatoscopic images.
- **Image Classification**: The system supports two classes—**benign** and **malignant**—for skin lesion classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: The models leverage pre-trained weights from ImageNet to improve performance with limited training data.
- **Web Application**: A simple, user-friendly interface developed using Flask allows users to upload images of skin lesions and receive real-time classification results.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate model performance, with DenseNet121 achieving an accuracy of 90.7%.

### Technical Stack:
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Backend**: TensorFlow and Keras
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS with Flask templates
- **Model**: ResNet50, DenseNet121, InceptionV3
- **Dataset**: Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Deployment**: Localhost for testing (can be extended to cloud deployment)

### Future Enhancements:
- Implementing real-time predictions through cloud integration.
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse skin tones and lesion types to improve generalizability.
- Enhancing the model's interpretability using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for better clinical trust.
